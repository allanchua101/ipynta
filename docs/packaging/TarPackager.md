# TarPackager

`TarPackager` is used for extracting the contents of `TAR` files.

## Use-case

Data scientists would usually compress their image datasets inside a `TAR` file to achieve the following:

- Reduce number of HTTP transactions required to upload/download datasets to/from remote storages
- Reduce image dataset's size on disk

### Example Usage

```py
import ipynta.packaging import TarPackager

tar_path = "./foo.tar"
dest_path = "./foo"

packager = TarPackager(tar_path, dest_path)

# unpack method returns the list of file
# paths extracted out of the TAR file.
files = packager.unpack()
```
